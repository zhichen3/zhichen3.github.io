*** Introduction
Due to the stiff nature of solving reaction equations for simulating
thermonuclear explosions, i.e. Type Ia SN and X-ray bursts, these simulations
require careful coupling of hydrodynamics and reactions to avoid being limited
by the nuclear reaction timescale instead of hydrodynamic timescale.
But as temperature reaches beyond ~ 6 billion Kelvin, numerical integration
becomes even more challenging when the timescale of the composition to reach
statistical equilibrium is much shorter than the sound crossing time.
Inspired by earlier [[https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/493/4/5413/5766330?login=false][work in the community]] at adaptively evaluating the
nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE) conditions, we have implemented an
adaptive NSE method in our simplified spectral-deferred-corrections (SDC)
coupling of hydrodynamics and reactions. This can seamlessly transition from
integrating a network to imposing the equilibrium during the reaction update of a simulation.

In this work, we demonstrate the recent effort of implementing an adaptive NSE algorithm
in Castro/Microphysics code. We will show case its viability using a 2D sub-chandrasekhar
double-detonation progenitor model for type Ia SN.
*** Nuclear Statistical Equilibrium

Nuclear Statistical Equilibrium (NSE) is an equilibrium state of the system where the
forward and reverse strong reactions are in chemical equilibrium. By imposing chemical equilibrium,
one can derive the equation that determines the composition in NSE:

$$ X_i = \frac{m_i}{\rho}g_i \left(\frac{2\pi m_i k_B T}{h^2}\right)^{3/2} \exp{\left(\frac{Z_i \mu_p + N_i \mu_n + Q_i - u^C_i}{k_B T}\right)} $$

Given (T, \rho, Y_{e}), then the NSE equation can be solved with two constraints:
1. Conservation of mass: $\sum_i X_i = 1$
2. Conservation of charge: $Y_e = \sum_i \frac{Z_i X_i}{A_i}$

Therefore, we can do an algebraic solve, e.g. Hybrid-Powell method or Newton-Raphson method,
to avoid the expensive integration.

*** Network Prerequisite
Some basic prerequisite for the reaction network include:
- Contains a least proton and Helium-4.
- Mass fractions in equilibrium obtained from integration
  should match with the mass fraction obtained from NSE equations.
- Screening is compatible with NSE, e.g. Chabrier & Potekhin 1998 screening.
*** NSE Conditions
Before using the NSE equation, we must first determine whether the current
simulation cell is in NSE. An overview of the NSE evolution schematic diagram
is shown in [[fig:diagram]]

#+name: fig:diagram
#+attr_html: :width 75%
#+caption: NSE evolution schematic diagram
[[../content/research/nse/nse-schematic-diagram.png]]

These checks include:
1. Minimum Temperature Check: temperature of the cell must exceed a certain value,
   by default this is 4 \times 10^{9}

2. Mass Abundance Check: the current mass abundances should be close to the NSE
   mass fractions.

   If there are proton, neutron, and Helium-4 are present in the network,
   then define r = Y_{\alpha}/(Y_{p}^{2}Y_{n}^{2}) and r_{nse} = (Y_{\alpha}/(Y_{p}^{2}Y_{n}^{2}))_{nse}, and require

   $$ \frac{r - r_{nse}}{r_{nse}} < 0.5 $$

   If there are only proton and helium-4, then define
   r = Y_{\alpha}/Y_{p}^{2} and r_{nse} = (Y_{\alpha}/(Y_{p}^{2}))_{nse} and require:

   $$ \frac{r - r_{nse}}{r_{nse}} < 0.25 $$

   If the check above failed, then we proceed to an overall molar fraction check:

   $$ \epsilon_{abs} = \sum_{i} |Y^{i} - Y^{i}_{nse}| < \epsilon_{abs}^{nse} $$

   and

   $$ \epsilon_{rel} = \sum_{i} \frac{\epsilon_{abs} }{ Y^{i} }< \epsilon_{rel}^{nse} $$

3. NSE Grouping: Perform a grouping process to all the nuclei. Based on the final
   grouping configuration, we determine whether the network is currently in NSE or not.


*** NSE Burn
Once the cell is determined to be in NSE, mass fraction is determined by the NSE equation.
However, a careful calculation is needed to determine the energy generation rates.

*** Introduction
Millisecond burst oscillation phenomenon is often observed during the rise time
of the X-ray burst light curve, where the oscillation frequency matches with the
X-ray emission pulsation of the neutron star within few Hz.
The modulation of asymmetrical burning on the surface of the neutron star
due to the spreading of the initial local hotspot is the current contender theory
that explains this behavior.
Many have attempted to model the laterally flame propagation on the neutron star surface,
with successes at studying the flame front and calculating the flame speed.
In this project, I conducted a sensitivity test on how choices of nuclear reaction network,
plasma screening routines, and integration coupling methods can influence the He flame dynamics.
Details of the work is published in [[https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/acec72][ApJ]].
*Here I'll just summarize the most important finding on the effect of nuclear reaction network
on flame dynamics and nucleosynthesis*.

*** Initial Model
We used [[https://github.com/AMReX-Astro/Castro][Castro]], a compressible hydrodynamics simulation code freely available on GitHub, to
perform all the simulations. Nuclear reaction burning related modules are provided via [[https://github.com/AMReX-Astro/Microphysics][Microphysics]].
To set the stage, we assumed a typical 1.4 M_{\odot} neutron star with radius of 11 km.
We used a relative a relatively higher \Omega = 1000 Hz to have a greater flame confinement due to
Coriolis force so that a smaller simulation domain.
A parallel-plane geometry with 2D axisymmetric R-Z cylindrical coordinate system is used.
We considered a simulation domain of r = 1.843 \times 10^{5} cm and z = 3.072 \times 10^{4} cm,
taking place on the surface of the rotating pole, where Coriolis force is the maximum.
A coarse grid of 1152 \times 192 zones were used, corresponding to 160 cm resolution.
With 2 extra AMR levels, there are 9216 \times 1536 zones for the finest grid, corresponding
to a 20 cm resolution.
A constant gravity is z is used since the mass of the accretion layer
is negligible compared to the mass the neutron star.
This corresponds to \sim 10^{\circ} away from the pole at the maximum extent,
allowing us to work with a constant Coriolis force in the co-rotating frame of the neutron star.
Initially, the fuel layer is assumed to have pure He^{4} uniformly distributed horizontally in
an isentropic atmosphere for z > 2000 cm.
An isothermal base layer comprised of pure Ni^{56} for z < 2000 cm to represent the transition to
the interior of the neutron star.
Since the model is initially in hydrostatic equilibrium, we placed a temperature perturbation profile of
1.2 \times 10^{9} K at the base of the He^{4} layer for r < 4.096 \times 10^{4} cm to facilitate nuclear burning,
compared to T = 2 \times 10^{8} K at the base of the He^{4} layer for r > 4.096 \times 10^{4} cm.
Figure [[fig:init_temp]] shows the initial temperature profile on the left side of the domain.
The total simulation time is 120 ms to prevent flame propagating outside the domain.

#+name: fig:init_temp
#+attr_html: :width 95%
#+caption: Slice plot showing the initial temperature pertubation. Note this only shows a small fraction of the domain.
[[../content/research/xrb-sensitivity/init_temp.png]]

*** Reaction Network
Several reaction networks were used to test the sensitivity of nuclear physics
to flame dynamics. Here we only discuss the one that is found to be most
relevant, /subch_simple/, a network comprised of 22 isotopes and 57 rates.
See Figure [[fig:subch_simple]] for visualizations.

#+name: fig:subch_simple
#+attr_html: :width 85%
#+caption: A visualization that shows the /subch_simple/ network.
[[../content/research/xrb-sensitivity/subch_simple.png]]


The classic 13-isotope \alpha-chain network from ${}^{4}\mbox{He}$ to ${}^{56}\mbox{Ni}$ , /aprox13/,
is used as a reference network for comparison. See Figure [[fig:aprox13]] for visualizations.

#+name: fig:aprox13
#+attr_html: :width 85%
#+caption: A visualization that shows the /aprox13/ network.
[[../content/research/xrb-sensitivity/aprox13.png]]


The most important difference between /subch_simple/ and /aprox13/ is inclusion of the rate sequence,
${}^{12}\mbox{C}(\mbox{p}, \gamma) {}^{13}\mbox{N}(\alpha, \mbox{p}){}^{16}\mbox{O}$.
1D studies have shown that this rate sequence dominates over \alpha-capture process
on ${}^{12}\mbox{C}$, ${}^{12}\mbox{C} (\alpha, \gamma) {}^{16}\mbox{O}$ for $T \gtrsim 10^9$ K,
which is responsible for generating a burst of energy as temperature increases
during the start of the burst.

*** Results

#+name: fig:abar
#+attr_html: :width 75%
#+caption: Slice plots showing the mean molecular weight for simulations that used different reaction network at 50 ms simulation time. A larger coverage and deeper color of the mean molecular weight for /subch_simple/ (bottom panel) indicates a much more vigorous burning process compared to /aprox13/ (top panel).
[[../content/research/xrb-sensitivity/network_abar_50ms_finesst.png]]

Our 2D simulations show a general agreement with these 1D studies.
Figure [[fig:abar]] shows the mean molecular weight, $\bar{A}$, of the flame at 50 ms
using the two networks. Regions with a larger $\bar{A}$ represent the ashes from nuclear burning.
Compared to /aprox13/, /subch_simple/ shows a larger coverage of ash structure,
both vertically and horizontally, indicating much more vigorous burning and a faster flame speed.
A darker color indicate ashes are composed of heavier nuclei suggesting much more frequent
late-stage burning processes.


#+name: fig:profile
#+attr_html: :width 85%
#+caption: Time evolution of density weighted temperature and energy generation rate of the flame. /subch_simple/ (red) shows spikes in energy generation rate (right panel) initially and at t ~ 20 ms compared to a steady increase in /aprox13/ (blue). This corresponds to the steeper increase in temperature (left panel) for t < 25 ms for /subch_simple/.
[[../content/research/xrb-sensitivity/network_time_profile_finesst.png]]


Figure [[fig:profile]] shows the evolution of density-weighted temperature and
$\dot{e}_{\text{nuc}}$ of the flame. Instead of a steady increase in both temperature
and $\dot{e}_{\text{nuc}}$ in /aprox13/, /subch_simple/ shows burst of energies
at $\sim 20$ ms and a quick fall off afterwards.

#+name: fig:species
#+attr_html: :width 90%
#+caption: Time evolution of the total mass for C12, O16, and Si32. A depletion of C12 is observed at ~ 20 ms for /subch_simple/ (red) compared to /aprox13/ (blue), indicating a much more efficient burning for C12 is available in /subch_simple/. This leads to nucleosynthesis of heavier isotopes like Si32.
[[../content/research/xrb-sensitivity/network_species_summary_log_finesst.png]]


To understand the behavior of this evolution trajectory,
Figure [[fig:species]] shows the total mass evolution of ${}^{12}\mbox{C}$, ${}^{16}\mbox{O}$, and ${}^{32}\mbox{Si}$.
In contrast to the continuous buildup of ${}^{12}\mbox{C}$  in /aprox13/
since the network is bottle-necked by ${}^{12}\mbox{C} (\alpha, \gamma) {}^{16}\mbox{O}$,
${}^{12}\mbox{C}(\mbox{p}, \gamma) {}^{13}\mbox{N}(\alpha, \mbox{p}){}^{16}\mbox{O}$
opens up a new path way for fusing ${}^{16}\mbox{O}$ in /subch_simple/ at $t \sim 20$ ms with a
corresponding $T \sim 1.3 \times 10^9$ K. At this point, nuclear burning timescale for
${}^{12}\mbox{C}(\mbox{p}, \gamma) {}^{13}\mbox{N}(\alpha, \mbox{p}){}^{16}\mbox{O}$ is faster than
the rate at which ${}^{12}\mbox{C}$ is produced by the triple-$\alpha$ process.
This leads to a depletion of ${}^{12}\mbox{C}$, corresponding to the burst of energy observed in
Figure [[fig:profile]] at $t \sim 20$ ms, as well as an early fuel exhaustion compared to /aprox13/.


#+name: fig:front
#+attr_html: :width 40%
#+caption: Time evolution of the flame front position. An initial acceleration phase is observed for /subch\_simple/ (red) in contrast to a global uniform flame propagation in /aprox13/ (blue).
[[../content/research/xrb-sensitivity/network_front_finesst.png]]


In terms of flame speed, Figure [[fig:front]] shows as initial short acceleration phase
for /subch_simple/ following by an uniform speed of $\sim 1.5 \ \text{km} \ \text{s}^{-1}$ similar to /aprox13/.
By extrapolating beyond the data, calculations show both models takes $\sim 1.5$ s
to reach 30 km, roughly the distance flame needs to travel to engulf the entire star.
This matches with the rise time of the light curve as we discussed previously.
This study gives us the confidence that /subch_simple/ is the optimal network to use
for the future full-star simulation, where we determine the time for the flame to
reach maximum coverage of the star along with the influence of Coriolis force modulation
without extrapolation.

*** Summary

All the results shown proves that ${}^{12}\mbox{C}(\mbox{p}, \gamma) {}^{13}\mbox{N}(\alpha, \mbox{p}){}^{16}\mbox{O}$
is critical for an accurate modeling of the laterally propagating He flames in X-ray bursts
because it changes both nucleosynthesis and flame dynamics drastically.
Lastly, we provide a movie showing flame propagation. Three different panels
showing temperature, $\bar{A}$, and $\dot{e}_\text{nuc}$, from top to bottom.

This was my research project during my [[https://science.osti.gov/wdts/suli][SULI]] internship in 2021.
I was interested in estimating the precision of the
[[https://astro.theoj.org/article/39641-two-photon-amplitude-interferometry-for-precision-astrometry][two-photon interferometry]] technique
for measuring the relative separation between two light-sources (i.e. stars)
using Markov-Chain Monte Carlos (MCMC) simulation.

*** Two-photon Interferometer Overview

Assume there are two sources which can be observed simultaneously from two stations,
*L*  and *R* , with single spatial mode inputs /a/, /b/  and /e/, /f/.
Both sources send out photons in the form of plane wave, the path length difference
between the two stations yielding phase delays $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$ between the photons observed
at channels /a/, /e/ from source 1 and /b/, /f/ from source 2, respectively.
If the two detected photons are close enough in frequency and arrival time,
then the pattern of coincidences measured at the outputs /c/, /d/ and /g/, /h/
will be sensitive to the difference in phase delays
after interference at the symmetric beam splitter in each station.

$$ \Delta\delta = \delta_{1} - \delta_{2} = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda} \vec{B} \cdot (\hat{s_1} - \hat{s_2}) + \psi $$

where $\vec{B}$ is the baseline of the two detectors and \psi is a constant phase-shift
due to instrumental path length difference between the two telescope.
And here \Delta\delta encodes the relative separation between the two sources.

*** Procedure of Bayesian Analysis.

The analysis involves two parts:

1. Simulate coincidences following Poisson process
2. Feed the sampled data to MCMC and see if we can recover the original parameters used
   such as visibility and the separation between two sources.

**** Simulating Coincidence

#+attr_html: :width 75%
#+caption: Schematic picture the fringe pattern. The blue curve represents a theoretical fringe pattern, and orange points are events detected.
[[../content/research/interferometry/simulated_coincidences.jpeg]]

Summary:
1. Since fringes will vary in frequency as Earth rotates, we first determine the period
   of each fringe cycle denoted by \Delta{}t's.
2. Determine the number of detections within each fringe cycle via $\bar{n} \times \Delta t$
3. Determine the phase, \phi, of these events in each fringe cycle.
4. Find the timestamp of these events corresponding to the phase, \phi.

We knew the rate for different two-photon coincidence rate type (i.e. the blue curve)
will be in the form:

$$ R_{\pm}(t) = \bar{n} \left(1 \pm V \cos(\delta_1 - \delta_2) \right) $$

where $\bar{n}$ is the fringed-average value of R, and /V/ is the fringe visibility calculated
from the fluxes of the two sources. We can determine \Delta{}t's from the curve, as well as the
number of events in each fringe cycle.

Now the form of R(t) tells us that the probability density function is of the form:

$$ PDF(x) = \frac{1 \pm V\cos{(x)}}{2\pi}  \quad \quad \quad  x\in[-\pi, \pi] $$

and the cumulative density function (CDF) after integrating PDF from -\pi to \phi.

$$ CDF(\phi) = \frac{\phi \pm V\sin{(\phi)} + \pi}{2\pi}  \quad \quad \quad  \phi\in[-\pi, \pi] $$

With a random number generator following Poisson distribution, we feed a number from 0 to 1
to CDF. By inverting the CDF, we then obtain the phase, \phi, representing a coincidence.
After obtaining \phi for each fringe cycle,
we can just find the corresponding timestamp corresponding to R(t).

**** MCMC Sampling

After simulating our data points following Poisson distribution,
now we explore the posterior using MCMC procedure. There are 4 parameters to vary,
visibility, /V/, separation of the two sources in the east-west direction \Delta{}d_E,
north-south direction \Delta{}d_N, and the arbitrary phase, \psi.

The result gives a bunch of triangle correlation plots showing correlation between different
parameters.

[[../content/research/interferometry/ew_1as_mix_20_1.png]]

*** Result

In the end, I was able to show two telescopes with an effective collecting area of $\sim 2\text{m}^2$,
we could detect fringing and measure the astrometric separation of the sources at $\sim$ 100 \micro{}as
of precision in a few hours of observations.
