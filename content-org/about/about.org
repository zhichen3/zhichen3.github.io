*Hi* there! I am a graduate student in astrophysics at [[https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/grad-physics-astronomy/][Stony Brook University]].
I work with [[https://zingale.github.io/][Michael Zingale]] on the development of numerical algorithms and their applications
in modeling astrophysical thermonuclear explosion events, such as X-ray bursts.

Beyond academia, I enjoy playing fingerstyle guitar, reading manga,
working on hands-on projects, and relaxing with my cat, NianNian.

Feel free to reach out to me at zhi.chen.3@stonybrook.edu.
