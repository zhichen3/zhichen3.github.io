I'm interested in exploring the flame dynamics and nucleosynthesis of Type I X-ray bursts
through numerical modeling. Below are my past and ongoing projects related to X-ray bursts:


## The effect of Coriolis Force Variations on Flame Dynamics on X-ray Bursts (Ongoing) {#the-effect-of-coriolis-force-variations-on-flame-dynamics-on-x-ray-bursts--ongoing}


## Sensitivity of He Flames in X-ray Bursts to Nuclear Physics (2023) {#sensitivity-of-he-flames-in-x-ray-bursts-to-nuclear-physics--2023}
