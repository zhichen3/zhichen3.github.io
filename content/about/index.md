**Hi** there! I am a graduate student in astrophysics at [Stony Brook University](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/grad-physics-astronomy/).
I work with [Michael Zingale](https://zingale.github.io/) on the development of numerical algorithms and their applications
in modeling astrophysical thermonuclear explosion events, such as X-ray bursts.

Beyond academia, I enjoy playing fingerstyle guitar, reading manga,
working on hands-on projects, and relaxing with my cat, NianNian.

Feel free to reach out to me at zhi.chen.3@stonybrook.edu.
